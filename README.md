# signal_analysis
This project focuses on the analysis and generation of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) signals in MATLAB. OFDM is a widely used modulation technique in modern communication systems, including WiMAX and WiFi. The project is organized into four tasks, each addressing specific aspects of OFDM signal processing and analysis.
